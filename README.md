# Green-Exchange
This old Fortran90 code from 2013 calculates exchange integrals (spin-polarized case) or magnetic susceptibility (non-polarized case) 
in the Wannier function basis using the Green's function formalism. As input, the code uses TB Hamiltonian generated by
Wannier90 package for spin-up and spin-down channels. Input parameters are provided in the file `control.inp`, which is
self-explainatory. The output is written in the file `exchange.dat`, which contains exchange interactions in real space
in the same format as the input TB Hamiltonian.
